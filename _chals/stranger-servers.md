popupcontent: Mike, something weird is going on at the library. I was able to hack into some russian form I found on the website. I think the they're  using the library as a front for more mindflayer research. I can't find where the form is again but if you can find it and gain admin access, we might be able to find what they're up to. Here's the link to the library website. Oh, and i think "роботы" has something to do with it all. </br> ~ Dustin

It's the early *90's* and several years after the last season Stranger Things. Mike and the gang are home in Hawkins after their first semester of college. Eleven, Hopper, and Dustin recently came across some weird activity in the Hawkins Community library, and mentioned something about it being a front for Russian Intelligence operations. They've all gone missing and the only clue is this cryptic message Dustin sent in an IM chat. Can you help Mike and the gang find where they went?
